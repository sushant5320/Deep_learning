# Food Vision using Tensorflow

## Overview
Welcome to the Food Vision project! This deep learning project is focused on building a powerful image classification system for identifying various food items. The project utilizes transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques with the ResNet50 model, leveraging the capabilities of TensorFlow.

## Project Highlights
Model: ResNet50V2
Techniques: Transfer Learning, Fine-Tuning
Dataset: Food101 dataset from TensorFlow Datasets

## Results
Here I got a validation accuracy of approx 74%.

## Future Improvements
Here we can try to unfreeze only a few topmost layers while fine-tuning coz the above project trained on the entire resnet50v2 model architecture. By doing this we can decrease the complexity of the model and take less time to train the model.
